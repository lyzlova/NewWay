                Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having
                the right frame of mind. The truth is, our thoughts are very
                powerful.
                <span class="more">
                  They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily
                  lives, from our physical health to our social behaviors. I’m
                  sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”
                  If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our
                  thoughts. Harnessing the power of thought in a positive way
                  has the ability to create great change in our lives, including
                  our financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we
                  take something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest them
                  into a physical reality? We must first understand that being
                  prosperous is more than having a lot of money. Prosperity is a
                  mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of
                  thinking. Mastering this train of thought is not easy, but it
                  is simple enough if we keep working on it consistently.
                  Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts,
                  and ultimately attract more prosperity into your life: Be
                  grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few
                  minutes each day to express heartfelt gratitude for the good
                  things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these
                  blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the
                  right direction — on abundance, not lack. Use positive
                  affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively.
                  Use “I am” statements such as “I am worthy of all that is
                  good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly
                  before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into
                  your subconscious mind, and you will begin to naturally
                  believe them. Creative visualization can help you achieve
                  prosperity by determining what it is you wish to achieve, and
                  then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works
                  in the same way affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill
                  with images of prosperity, and eventually these subconscious
                  “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as
                  being prosperous, and you will become so. Encourage yourself
                  with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could
                  also be one of your affirmations, but expand on it. If you
                  know you can earn a certain salary, tell yourself you can earn
                  more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and
                  you will gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you
                  ever imagined you could. If you believe you can do it, you are
                  more likely to take the risks associated with people who are
                  highly successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so
                  take risks and aim higher. Start a savings account. As strange
                  as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like. Even if
                  you can only afford to put a few dollars into your account
                  every month, it will begin to build up and attract more money.
                  Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability
                  of our thoughts is such that we lend more power and energy to
                  whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will
                  create more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will
                  create . . . guess what? Remember that this is a process. You
                  likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over
                  time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to
                  attract what you want. Once you master this power of thought,
                  there are truly no limits to what you can create!

                Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll
                look at the big ‘R’ of recognition and how a digital advertising
                network may help.
                <span class="more">
                  Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a
                  crowded room at a party. Both walk to the far side of the
                  room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and unnoticed
                  as they reach the far side. The second person takes much
                  longer to reach the far side because they are engaged in
                  conversations along the way as they continue to meet
                  acquaintances and friends during their path. Which type of
                  person would you like to model your business after? Your
                  business is in a continual battle for your customers’
                  recognition whether you know it or not. If you happen to be
                  fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few
                  competitors, that will not last for long. You need your
                  business to be at the forefront of your client’s minds so that
                  when they require your products or services, you are the go-to
                  people. Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your
                  name and logo out there and keeping it there is a must. This
                  lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business.
                  Frequency is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in
                  recognition. I am reminded of both television and radio ads I
                  had heard of in the past. They run continually with a catch
                  phrase or musical jingle over and over again on the radio or
                  television until you are absolutely sick of hearing it. You
                  also cannot get it out of your head. Although this type of
                  advertising is expensive, it can be very effective, and the
                  recognition factor is quite high. Television and radio can
                  reach a large audience, and they are broad in their appeal. In
                  a brief sentence, you are paying to market to both those that
                  are your potential customers and a large segment of those who
                  are not now and probably never will be your customers. There
                  are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to
                  define your target market demographic, and invest your
                  marketing funds into the locations that will best be seen by
                  them. Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a
                  place where I will stand out from my competition, or where my
                  competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market
                  yourself in a flyer or newspaper right beside your competition
                  and risk blending into a crowd, and ultimately being ignored?
                  Another issue to look at is diversification. As the saying
                  goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look
                  at your advertising budget for the year, try to find the
                  affordable solutions that will continue to reap during the
                  full year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or
                  television promotion may give short term gains for that
                  weekend sale, but what about the rest of the year? Your
                  clients may end up with the impression of where did they go, I
                  haven’t seen or heard anything about them for so long. Don’t
                  always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your
                  eyes and ears open for the latest and greatest ways to market
                  your business. With the costs of technology coming down
                  dramatically new options such as digital advertising on LCD
                  and Plasma screens are becoming more and more affordable, and
                  the paper billboards and posters becoming a thing of the past.
                  With the flexibility, and curb appeal of full color and motion
                  video footage with computer generated graphics available to
                  you, this is an option you don’t want to pass by without a
                  good look. Ultimately, recognition is required if you want to
                  get people “in the door” of your business (or on your website
                  for the new e-businesses). This is going to cost you money,
                  time and effort up front any way that you look at it, but if
                  you have successfully reached your target market, the payoffs
                  will be worth it.</span

                      searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them
                      is that you only have to post once and they are good for
                      long periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you
                      don’t have to resubmit your information every week or
                      every month. The bad news is most of your traffic won’t
                      come from here. I still feel it is worth it to get your
                      link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for
                      posting to free directories. You won’t need to do it again
                      for at least 6 months. 2. Classified Ads: These are great
                      for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do
                      people go when they are looking for a job? That’s
                      right-the classifieds. The only downside to classified ads
                      is that you have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once
                      you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you
                      can concentrate on them and weed the others out. So it is
                      really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t
                      have to be later on when you get the hang of things. 3.
                      Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform
                      others about your product or service is to write an
                      article about it. In your authors resource box, you can
                      tell readers about yourself and where they can go to check
                      out your product or service. This is also an excellent way
                      to get free links to your site if you have one. There are
                      a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for good
                      articles they can post on their site. If they post yours,
                      that is another site that is doing the advertising for
                      you. All for free. 4. URL Submissions: Probably the
                      quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your site.
                      Just type “Free URL submission” in your search engine.
                      When you get a list just enter the URL you are promoting
                      and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a few seconds
                      and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months
                      and do this. 5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service
                      website in your signature file when you sign up on some
                      forums. It will be displayed every time you make a post.
                      Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge on,
                      and can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone,
                      you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad
                      reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions
                      that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great
                      because once you make a post it stays there forever. It
                      will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone
                      could still find it if they were searching the archives.
                      Yes, there are many people who do. 6. Traffic Exchanges:
                      Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for
                      free, but definately the most effective. Most forums I
                      have visited have said in many posts that they received a
                      lot of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you don’t
                      want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have
                      the option of buying them. I would look into a program
                      that lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy
                      browser. There are others and they are free to download.
                      That way you can just spend one hour a day and get all
                      your surfing in at once. 7. News-groups: Become involved
                      in a group that has to do with your kind of business. You
                      can usually mail the group once per day, but I would
                      encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each
                      day. People will tune you out if they see the same message
                      all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join
                      groups with the same interests as yours. In other words,
                      don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are
                      advertising shaving cream.

                    There are many things that are important to catalog
                    design....
                    <span class="more">
                      Your images must be sharp and appealing. Your text and
                      even the font you use for the text is important. The cover
                      page design and the design of your catalog’s product pages
                      all play important roles in designing a catalog that will
                      bring in new customers and sales. However none of the
                      things mentioned above are more important than the type of
                      paper you will choose to print your catalog on. The “feel”
                      of your catalog is important to your potential customers.
                      The longer they have your catalog in their hands, the more
                      product they will buy. In this article I will go over some
                      of the many paper choices you have to print your catalog
                      on. First you need to decide if the cover will be the same
                      paper as the rest of your catalog. In most cases the cover
                      will be of heavier weight then the interior pages. Second
                      you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for
                      printing your catalog. Coated paper is for the glossier
                      layouts and uncoated is more economical, but can still
                      display your products well. So you have two things to
                      consider first, “Will it be glossy paper or not?”, “Will
                      my cover be the same weight as the interior pages of my
                      catalog?” Once you have answered those two questions the
                      next decision is what the weight of the paper will be.
                      Most catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it
                      would be 60lb uncoated or coated, 70 lb. Coated or
                      uncoated. 80 lb. Paper usually is only chosen for 80 lb.
                      Weight and above. Also, not all paper is measured by
                      weight. Some is measured by thickness or “points”. Now the
                      above is really over-simplified. There are other types of
                      special paper you can choose from. There is textured
                      paper, photographic paper, and other more expensive paper
                      to choose from if you are selling a high-end or expensive
                      product. There are also other considerations when choosing
                      the paper your catalog will be printed on. Such as the
                      method of printing you are going to choose. If you are
                      going to have your catalog printed on a hot-set web press,
                      then you can choose uncoated or coated paper. The heat
                      will dry the ink as it prints your catalog. If your
                      printer uses a cold-set web press then the ink air-dries
                      and is absorbed into the paper. A cold-set web press
                      cannot print on coated paper. If your printer uses a
                      sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high
                      quality papers they have available. The same goes for
                      printers that do digital printing. It will depend a lot on
                      the printer you choose. You need to find out what type of
                      paper is available and you will want to see samples of the
                      paper to get a better idea of which one you want to print
                      your catalog on. Also ask your printer to suggest the
                      different types of paper they think will be the best for
                      your catalog. Here is a list of some of the types of paper
                      your printer may have available for you to choose from or
                      may be able to order for you. Dull Coated Paper Matte
                      Coated Paper Glossy Coated Paper Antique Paper Vellum
                      Paper Wove Paper Smooth Paper Felt Paper Linen Paper
                      Fiber-added Paper Laid Paper Parchment Four things
                      determine the quality of the paper, opacity, brightness,
                      finish, and ppi. (Pounds per inch) Brightness affects the
                      contrast and brilliance of the paper. It affects how your
                      text will stand out on the pages of your catalog. Opacity
                      is how much your ink is visible from the back of the page.
                      If a paper is too opaque, your text and images from one
                      page will be seen through onto another page that your
                      customer is trying to read. The finish affects the feel of
                      the pages and also how your images will look. The lower
                      grade finishes produce grainier images while high quality
                      finishes sharpen the look of your images. Ask your printer
                      to provide you with samples or swatch booklets and a price
                      list for printing your catalog on the various types of
                      paper before you decide. You know what your budget is and
                      paper is only one of the expenses you have to consider.

                    Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that
                    are...
                    <span class="more">
                      searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them
                      is that you only have to post once and they are good for
                      long periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you
                      don’t have to resubmit your information every week or
                      every month. The bad news is most of your traffic won’t
                      come from here. I still feel it is worth it to get your
                      link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for
                      posting to free directories. You won’t need to do it again
                      for at least 6 months. 2. Classified Ads: These are great
                      for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do
                      people go when they are looking for a job? That’s
                      right-the classifieds. The only downside to classified ads
                      is that you have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once
                      you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you
                      can concentrate on them and weed the others out. So it is
                      really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t
                      have to be later on when you get the hang of things. 3.
                      Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform
                      others about your product or service is to write an
                      article about it. In your authors resource box, you can
                      tell readers about yourself and where they can go to check
                      out your product or service. This is also an excellent way
                      to get free links to your site if you have one. There are
                      a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for good
                      articles they can post on their site. If they post yours,
                      that is another site that is doing the advertising for
                      you. All for free. 4. URL Submissions: Probably the
                      quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your site.
                      Just type “Free URL submission” in your search engine.
                      When you get a list just enter the URL you are promoting
                      and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a few seconds
                      and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months
                      and do this. 5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service
                      website in your signature file when you sign up on some
                      forums. It will be displayed every time you make a post.
                      Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge on,
                      and can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone,
                      you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad
                      reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions
                      that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great
                      because once you make a post it stays there forever. It
                      will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone
                      could still find it if they were searching the archives.
                      Yes, there are many people who do. 6. Traffic Exchanges:
                      Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for
                      free, but definately the most effective. Most forums I
                      have visited have said in many posts that they received a
                      lot of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you don’t
                      want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have
                      the option of buying them. I would look into a program
                      that lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy
                      browser. There are others and they are free to download.
                      That way you can just spend one hour a day and get all
                      your surfing in at once. 7. News-groups: Become involved
                      in a group that has to do with your kind of business. You
                      can usually mail the group once per day, but I would
                      encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each
                      day. People will tune you out if they see the same message
                      all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join
                      groups with the same interests as yours. In other words,
                      don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are
                      advertising shaving cream.
