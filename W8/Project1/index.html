          This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling.
          About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo
          encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to
          clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals was too
          great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now
          and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them,
          for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and
          change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam
          could contain.

          The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but
          Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry,
          remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
          please the buffaloes to get out of the way. <br />
          Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to
          discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.

          "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in
          a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I
          should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme!
          And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into
          this herd of beasts!"

          The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.
